- Facade 
    - Exposing several components through a single interface
    - Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code  
    - Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes
    - May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the facade
    - May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if they need to
