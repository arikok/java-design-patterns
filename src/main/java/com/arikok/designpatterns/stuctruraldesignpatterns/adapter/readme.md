- Adapter 
    - A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y 

- Summary
    - Implementing an Adapter is easy
    - Determine the API you have and the API you need
    - Create a component which aggregates(has a reference too .. ) the adaptee
    - Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations
