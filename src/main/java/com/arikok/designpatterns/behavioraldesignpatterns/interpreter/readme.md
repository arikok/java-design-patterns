Iterator
    - Textual input needs to be processed
        - e.g., turned into OOP structures
    - Some Examples
        - Compilers
        - HTML XML
        - Expression

A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens and token interpreting sequences of said tokens

- Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stages
- Lexing turns text into a set of tokens
- Parsing tokens into meaningful constructs
- Parsed data can then be traversed
