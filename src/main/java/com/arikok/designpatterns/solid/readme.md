- Single Responsibility Principle
	- A class should only have one reason to change
	- Seperation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems
- Open-Closed Principle
	- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	- You shouldnt be modify tested code for extend functionality
- Liskov Substition Principle
	- You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
- Interface Segregation Principle
	- Don't put too much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces
	- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It
- Depedency Inversion Principle
	- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
	- High-level modules shouldn't be changed, when low-level modules changed.
